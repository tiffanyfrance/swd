          <h3>Precipitation</h3>
          <p>The wetest year on record is 2018 with percipitation total of 63.73 inches. 
            <!-- [Fall] is the season with the most precipitation, averaging [10 inches] per year between [May and August].
            [January] is the driest month in Richmond, with an average of [0] inches of rainfall.  -->
            Did you know?
            According to <a
              href="https://wgntv.com/2018/10/12/does-the-water-equivalent-of-snow-count-as-part-of-our-annual-rainfall-total-so-that-abundant-snowfall-could-make-up-for-a-drier-rainy-season/">WGN9</a>,
            "The annual precipitation total is arrived by summing the daily amounts of the water equivalent of all
            precipitation that has fallen. When precipitation falls as rain the amount is read directly from the
            official
            rain gauge and recorded in hundredths of an inch. The smallest amount of measurable precipitation is 0.01
            inch
            with lesser amounts recorded as a trace. When the precipitation falls as snow, the snow is collected in the
            rain gauge, melted and measured as if it fell as rain. Typically an inch of snow yields about 0.10 inches of
            liquid equivalent, but that can vary depending upon the temperature during the snowfall."</p>
