        I decided to <a href="https://konmari.com/pages/about">KonMari</a> my closet for the THIRD time this year (and it's only May!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Marie Kondo method has you hold each piece of clothing and decide whether it spark joy. If yes, you keep it. If not, you donate it. 
        The thing is there are so few items that bring me joy, and I still need to wear clothes, so the keep pile was a conbination spark joy and clothing basics (e.g. underwear, jeans, and workout clothes).
      </p>
      <p>
        This time of decluttering was more difficult than before since 
        (1) I had already donated/tossed the obvious bad fits and
        (2) because I decided to <a href="https://twitter.com/tiffylou/status/1125493087818661889">manually track</a> EVERY single item of clothing for this project.
      </p>
      <p>I am participating in May's <a href="http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/swdchallenge">#SWDchallenge</a>, which challenged participants to collect and visualize their own data.
        I included a rating, which was basically a "gut feeling" number that had no metrics or validity other than how I was feeling at the moment.
        When looking at the data a second time, the "gut rating" appeared essentially useless as a metric, therefore I went back and added 5 columns: Quality, Fit, Neccesity, Comfy, and Style. 
        I added a sixth column which was the average score of those more specific values. Interestingly, the weighted totals were similiar to the "gut rating" but they had more meaning behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the collection process I made some assumptions about the data. I appeared that few things sparked joy, however 62 of 323 items were marked as "sparked joy".
        Additionally, I've watched the show but never seen this: Some things that sparked joy ended up in the give away pile.
